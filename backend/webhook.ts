/**
 * Webhooks provide a way to listen to different events that happen in the
 * Stripe API.
 *
 * For example a payment intent object returns an id and status, the state of
 * that object can change over the lifecycle of the payment. There are certain
 * events that we want to listen to and then code in response like when payment has
 * succeeded or failed
 *
 * In order to receive actual webhook event from Stripe we need to have a URL that's
 * available on the internet but if the app is not deployed then to test the webhooks
 * in development use Stripe CLI. It allows us to send test and mock webhooks in
 * development to localhost which means you don't need real URL on the internet for
 * testing
 *
 * *** Trigger Webhooks Locally ***
 *
 * Open a terminal to forward webhooks to the server.
 * command => stripe listen --forward-to localhost:8000/api/payments/hooks
 *
 * Then open another terminal to trigger a mock webhook.
 * command => stripe trigger payment_intent.created
 *
 * To listen to certain webook using Stripe CLI
 * stripe listen --events=`event.status`
 * Example:
 * stripe listen --events=customer.subscription.deleted
 * stripe listen --events=customer.subscription.created
 * stripe listen --events=invoice.payment_succeeded
 * stripe listen --events=invoice.payment_failed
